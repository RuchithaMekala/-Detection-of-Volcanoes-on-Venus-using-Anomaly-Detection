# -Detection-of-Volcanoes-on-Venus-using-Anomaly-Detection

- Developed a machine learning model to detect volcanoes on Venus using Magellan spacecraft images, enhancing planetary exploration efficiency.
- Employed anomaly detection techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Convolutional Autoencoders, utilizing reconstruction error metrics like Structural Similarity Index(SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio(PSNR) for improved model performance.
- Conducted data preprocessing, including image normalization and glitch detection.
- Compared and evaluates the effectiveness of CNN and anomaly detection methods for identifying volcanic activity on Venus.
